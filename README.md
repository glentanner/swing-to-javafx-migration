# Swing to JavaFX Migration Study

This repository documents my study of migrating legacy Java Swing applications to JavaFX.  
It complements my fork of [JetUML](https://github.com/prmr/JetUML), an open-source UML diagram tool that transitioned from Swing to JavaFX in version 2.0.

## Purpose
- Explore strategies for modernizing Java desktop applications.
- Experiment with incremental migration techniques (e.g., hybrid Swing/JavaFX).
- Track notes, patterns, and lessons learned along the way.

## Key Files
- [`MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md): Detailed study notes, migration plan template, and references.

## References
- [JetUML](https://github.com/prmr/JetUML)
- [OpenJFX](https://openjfx.io)

## Status
This is a work in progress. The repo will grow as I explore JetUMLâ€™s migration and test migration patterns in small Java code samples.
