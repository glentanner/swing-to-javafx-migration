# Swing to JavaFX Migration Guide

This project serves as a personal study and documentation effort on migrating legacy Java Swing applications to JavaFX.  
It complements my fork of [JetUML](https://github.com/prmr/JetUML), which transitioned from Swing to JavaFX starting in version 2.0.

---

## üéØ Goals
- Understand practical steps for modernizing Swing-based desktop applications.
- Explore incremental migration techniques (Swing + JavaFX hybrid).
- Document challenges, solutions, and patterns observed during study.
- Experiment with small UI components as test cases.

## üõ† Migration Plan Template

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Inventory existing UI
- List main windows, dialogs, panels.
- Identify custom-painted components or graphics-heavy areas.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Choose a migration approach
- Hybrid: integrate JavaFX into Swing via `JFXPanel`, or embed Swing in JavaFX via `SwingNode`.
- Full refactor: rewrite components fully in JavaFX.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set up JavaFX scaffolding
- Add OpenJFX as a dependency (modular or classpath).
- Create `Application` subclass with `Stage` and `Scene`.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Incremental migration
- Replace non-critical dialogs and panels first.
- Migrate custom painting to JavaFX `Canvas` or `Scene Graph`.
- Switch event listeners to JavaFX‚Äôs event/binding model.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Handle threading
- Ensure UI changes occur on the JavaFX Application Thread.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Validate and test
- Confirm matching behavior and appearance.
- Compare performance where relevant.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Remove legacy Swing dependencies
- Once migration is complete, clean out hybrid wrappers.

## üí° Notes
- JavaFX version: 21 (current LTS)
- Useful libraries: ControlsFX, ScenicView, JFoenix (optional)

## üìå TODO
- [ ] Study JetUML‚Äôs migration commits (v1.x ‚Üí v2.x).
- [ ] Try migrating a simple Swing panel to JavaFX.
- [ ] Document code patterns that help/hinder migration.
- [ ] Explore hybrid Swing + JavaFX embedding in practice.
